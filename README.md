# 2BeDone-PWA-Backend

## [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/leolazz/2bedone-PWA-frontend)

# Description:

2BeDone-PWA is a rebuild of my first project, but now as progressive web app using a new stack.

### Why I made this:

While getting on boarded to work a project called the LazzTech hub app I realized that since it was already to so far into development there would be aspects of this new stack I would not get exposure to. I decided to rebuild 2BeDone in this new stack to accelerate the onboarding increase my breadth of knowledge and experience in this new stack.

- Accelerate on boarding to lazztech hub
- Expand my understanding of a new stack
- Learn about designing for a dedicated cross platform experience

### Constraints & Challenges:

- Aiming to quickly to complete the project while:
  - Working on the Lazztech Hub
  - Trying to differentiate it from the original version
- Learning the nuances and complexity of:
  - Configuration and utilization of GraphQL
  - integrating apollo and its state management
- Monolithic size of Angular at first exposure

### Results:

Increased overall skill and knowledge base in a new tech stack while accelerating the onboarding process to the LazzTech Hub, and in the process found my preferred stack.
