# 2BeDone-PWA-Backend

## [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/leolazz/2bedone-PWA-frontend)

# Description:

2BeDone-PWA is a rebuild of my first project, but now as progressive web app using a new stack.

# Why I made this:

To rapidly learn Angular, Ionic, graphql, and Apollo. Furthermore, learn the difference of building a website/app that should be equally consumable in a desktop or mobile experience.

# Constraints & Challenges:

Learning a new stack while trying to complete the project quickly and make it feel different than the orignal version.

# Results:

Gained a solid and practical understanding of Angular, Ionic, GraphQl, and Apollo.
